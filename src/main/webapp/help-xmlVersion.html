    Cppcheck can generate output in XML format. There is an old XML format (version 1) and a new XML
    format (version 2). Please use the new version if you can.<br />
    The old version is kept for backwards compatibility only. It will not be changed, but it will likely be
    removed someday. Use <i>--xml</i> to enable this format.<br />
    The new version fixes a few problems with the old format. The new format will probably be updated in
    future versions of cppcheck with new attributes and elements. A sample command to check a file and
    output errors in the new XML format:<br />
    <b>cppcheck --xml-version=2 file1.cpp</b>
